2. Git Basics -
==============

obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
- take a local directory that is currently not under version control,
    and turn it into a Git respository or
        1. [cd] or [mkdir] a directory
        2. $ git init 
        /* 
         * This creates a new subdirectory .git that contains all of your
         * necessary repository files
         */

- clone an existing Git respository from elsewhere
        $ git clone https://github.com/artfu/notes
